We are a theory group based in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Bath, UK.

Our work involves the use of established computational chemistry techniques and codes to study the magnetic properties of materials and molecules, but we also work on the development of novel theories and software suited to solving particular challenges.

We are particularly interested in the use of paramagnetic NMR spectroscopy for the elucidation of magnetic properties, structure, and dynamics in both inorganic materials and biological systems. You can read more about our work on the [Research](./research.html) and [People](./people.html) pages.

Current PhD and post-doctoral opportunities are given on the [Opportunities](./opportunities.html) tab, but feel free to contact Elizaveta for informal discussions.

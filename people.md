    <p>
      Jon's work in Bath focusses on using computational chemistry techniques to enable the extraction of spin-Hamiltonian parameters from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy measurements.
    </p>
    <p>Outside of research, Jon can be found either renovating his house, or enjoying the delights of Bath's only good craft beer bar.</p>
